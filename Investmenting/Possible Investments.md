- Nio revenue growth?
- Baba is way down but very profitable
- RIOT blockchain and MARA. Riot just posted good earning but market didn't respond. I think they are overly scared because of the drop of Bitcoin. Also I think once Bitcoin goes back up RIOT will surge. Need to compare MARA to RIOT to see which one is better
