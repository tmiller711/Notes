Make an investments folder and make notes of companies/investments and try to link them with other companies and commodities with time frames to try and find patters and make connects.

Somehow analyze commodities and if I think the demand will grow/be good than look at companies that work with that commodity. If the commodity will decrease in demand possibly short those companies
