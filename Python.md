- Interpretted means you don't need to manually compile everytime you want to run a program
- [[classes]] in Python allow you to create [[data types]] and create embedded [[methods]] built into those data types
- A [[dictionary]] in Python is equivalent to a [[hash table]]
- Try and except allow you to attempt some code and if it fails do something else
- Strings in Python are immutable. Meaning the original string cannot be changed
- Having a main function call at the bottom of your program gets rid of issues with calling functions before they are defined
- To recreate a do-while loop in python you create an infinite loop and then break out of it if a statement turns True
- The [[scope]] of variables in Python says that if a variable is defined anywhere within a function (including inside of loops) it is available everywhere inside that function. While in C if a variable is defined within a loop it can only be accessed within that loop
