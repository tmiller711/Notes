- Intro:
	- Buy stocks as you buy groceries, not as you buy perfume. Don't forget to ask the question "how much?"
	- We shall suggest as one of our chief requirments here that our readers limit themselves to issues selling not far above their tangible-asset value
	- The really dreadful losses always occur after the buyer forgets to ask "How much?"
	- Obvious prospects for physical growth in a business do not translate into obvois profits for investors
- Chapter 1: Investment vs. Speculation
	- It should be remembered that between 1949 and 1969 the price of the DJIA had advanced more that fivefold while its earnings and dividends had about doubled. This means there was a lot of speculation amongst investors and not actual growth in companies. This is a bad sign
	- For defensive investors namely that at all times they have a significant part of their funds in bond-type holdings and a significant part also in equities. It is still true that they may choose between maintaining a simple 50-50 but that can vary between 25% and 75% both ways
	- The defensive investor must confine himself to the share of importatn companies with a long record of profitable operations and in strong financial condition
	- The search for stocks for aggressive investors is not worth the effort unless they could hope to add over 5% to the average return of your portfolio
- Chapter 2: The investor and inflation
	- There is no close time connection between inflationary (or deflationary) conditions and the movement of common-stock earnings and prices
	- The more the investor depends on his portfolio and the income therefrom, the more necessary it is for him to guard agaust the unexpected and the disconcerting in this part of his life
- Chaper 2 Commentary
	- It is important to measure your investing success not just by what you make, but by how much you keep after inflation
	- Two inflation fighters have popped up since 1970: REITs and TIPS
	- TIPS are best suited for tax-deferred retirement account like an IRA, Keogh, or 401k, where they will not jack up your taxable income
- Chapter 3: A century of stock market history
- Chapter 3 commentary
	- When every investor comes to believe that stock are guaranteed to make money in the long run, won't the market end up being widly overpried?
	- The value of any investment is, and always must be, a function of the price you pay for it
	- Graham's warning in this chapter is simple: "By the rule of opposites", the more enthusiastic investors become about the stock market in the long run, the more certain they are to be proved wrong in the short run
	- **The stock market's performance depends on three factors:**
		- real growth (the rise of companies' earnings and dividends)
		- inflationary growth (the general rise of prices throughout the economy)
		- speculaive growth-or decline (any increase or decrease in the investing public's appetite for stocks)
		- **In the long run, you can reasonably expect stock to average roughly a 6% return**
	- In the financial markets, the worse the future looks, the better it usually turns out to be
- Chapter 4: General portfolio policy for the defensive investor
	- The rate of return sought should be dependent on the amount of intelligent effort the investor is willing and able to bring to bear on his task
	- We are convinced that the 50-50 (stock to bond) approach makes sense for the defensive investor
	- There is no investment besides series E bonds (need to look into I bonds) that guarantee absolute assurance of principal and interest payments, the right to demand full money back at any time, and guarantee of at lesst 5% interest rate for at least en years
- Chapter 4 Commentary
	- There are two ways to be an intelligent investor:
		- By continually researching, selecting, and monitoring a dynamic mix of stocks, bonds, or mutual funds
		- Or by creating a permanent portfolio that runs on autopilot and requires no further effort (but generates very little excitement)
	- If you are following a ratio of stocks to bonds you should rebalance every 6 months
- Chapter 5: The defensive investor and common stocks
	- Rules for the selection of stocks for the defensive investor:
		- There should be adequate though not excessive diversitification. This might mean a minimum of ten different issues and a maximum of about thirty
		- Each compnay selected should be large, prominent, and conservatively financed. Indefiinite as these adjectives must be, their general sense is clear. Observations on this point are added at the end of the chapter
		- Each company should have a long record of continuous dividend payments
		- The investor should impose some limit on the price he will pay for an issue in relation to its average earnings over the past seven years. We suggest that this limit be set at 25 times such average earnings, and not more that 20 times those of the last twelve-month period
	- The term "growth stock" is applied to one which has increased its per-share earnings in the past at well above the rate for common stocks
	- To be prominent a company should rank among the first quarter or first third in size within its industry group
- Chapter 6: Portfolio policy for the enterprising investor: negative approach
	- Bull market periods are usually characterized by the transformation of a large number of privately owned businesses into companies with quoted shares
	- One fairly dependable sign of the approaching end of abull swing is the fact that new common stocks of small and nondescript companies are offered at prices somewhat higher than the current level for many medium-sized companeis with a long market history
	- Some IPO's persent excellent buys - a few years later, when nobody wants them and they can be had at a small fractions of their true worth
- Chapter 6 Commentary
	- Buying IPOs is a bad idea because it flagrantly violates on of Graham's most fundamental rules: no matter how many other people want to buy a stock, you should buy only if the stock is a cheap way to own a desirable business
- Chapter 7: Portfolio policy for the enterprising investor: the positive side
	- The activities specially characteristic of the enterprising investor int he common stock field may be classified under four heads:
		1. Buying in low markets and selling in high markets
		2. Buying carefully chosen "growth stocks"
		3. Buying bargain issues of various types
		4. Buying into "special situations"
	- The obtain better than average investment results over a long pull requires a policy of selection or operation possessing a twofold merit: (1) It must meet objective or rational tests of underlying soundness; and (2) it must different from the policy followed by most investors or speculators
	- Perhaps the agressive investor should start with the "low-multiplier" idea, but add other quantitative and qualitative requirements thereto in making up his portfolio
	- Purchase of Bargain Issues
		- We define a bargain issue as one which, on the basis of facts established by analysis, appears to be worth considerably more than it is selling for
		- A test to detect a common stock is by a method of appraisal. This relies largely on estimating future earnings and then multiplying these by a factor appropriate to the particular issue
		- The market is fond of making mountains out of molehills and exaggerating ordinary vicissitudes into major setbacks. This can create temporary bargains
		- The type of bargain issue that can be most readily indentified is a common stock that sells for less than the company's net working capital alone, after deducting all prior obligations (by "net working capital" graham means a company's current assets minus its total liabilites)
	- Baragin issue pattern in secondary companies
		- We have defined a secondary company as one that is not a leader in a fairly important industry. Thus it is usually one of the smaller concerns in its field, but it may equally we be the chief unit in an unimportant line. By way of exception, any company that has established itself as a growth stock is not ordinarily considered "secondary"
	- Special sitatuions or "workouts"
		- In order to make acquisations possible, and to obtain acceptance of the deal by the required large majority of shareholders of the smaller company, it is almost always necessary to offer a price considerably above the current level
		- Security markets tend to undervalue issues that are involved in any sort of complicated legal proceedings
- Chapter 7 Commentary
		- A great company is not a great investment if you pay too much for the stock
		- Growth stocks are worth buying when their prices are reasonable, but when their price/earnings ratios go much above 25 to 30 the odds get ugly
		- The intelligent investor gets interested in big growth stocks not when they are at their most popular but when something goes wrong
		- **The Bargain Bin** on page 186 show a way to find undervalued companies
		- If you live in the United States, work in the United States, and get paid in U.S dollars, you are already making a multilayered bet on the U.S. economy. To be prudent, you should put some of your investment portfolio elsewhere
- Chapter 8: The Investor and Market Fluctuations
		- Nearly all bull markets had a number of well-defined characteristics in common, such as (1) a historically high price level, (2) high price/earnings ratio, (3) low dividend yields as against bond yields, (4) much speculation on margin, and (5) many offerings of new common-stock issues of poor quality
		- The more successful a company, the grater are likely to be the fluctuations in the price of its shares
		- If an investor is to pay some special attention to the selection of his portfolio, it might be best for him to concentrate on issues selling at a reasonably close approximation to their tangible-asset value-say, at not more than one-third above that figure
		- The stock market often goes far wrong, and sometimes an alert and courageous investor can take advantage of its erros. The other is that most businesses change in character and quality over the years, sometimes for the better, perhaps more often for the worse
		- Good managements produce a good average market price, and bad managements produce bad market prices
		- If it is virtually impossible to make worthwile predictions about the price movements of stocks, it is completely impossible to do so for bonds
- Chapter 8 Commentary
	- Mr. Market's job is to provide you with prices; your job is to decide whether it is to your advantage to act on them. You do not have to trade with him just because he constantly begs you to
	- See pg. 218 for why it is easy to beat money managers
	- Selling into a bear market can make sense if it create a tax windfall. The U.S. Internal Revenue Code allows you to use your realized losses to offset up to $3,000 in ordinary income
- Chapter 9: Investing in Investment Funds
	- Our studies indicate that the investor in mutual-fund shares may properly consider comparative performance over a period of years in the past, say at least finve, provided the data do not represent a large net upward movement of the market as a whole
	- There is a strong indication that smaller size is a necessary factor for obtaining continued outstanding results
	- If you want to put money in investment funds, buy a group of closed-end shares at a discount of, say, 10% to 15% from asset value, isntead of paying a premium of about 9% above asset value for shares of an open-end company
	- It would appear more logical for the typical investor to make his bond-type investments directly, rather than to have them form part of a mutual-fund commitment
- Chapter 9 Commentary
	- Buying funds based off past performance alone is stupid
	- **To succeed, the individual investor must either avoid shopping from the same list of favoriate stocks that have already been picked over by the giant institutions, or own them far more patiently**
	- Late in his life, Graham praised index funds as the best choice for individual invesotrs, as does Warren Buffett
	- Qualifications for good funds (pg. 250): 
		1. Their managers are the biggest shareholders
		2. They are cheap
		3. The dare to be different
		4. They shut the door
		5. The don't advertise
	- **Before you buy a U.S. stock fund, compare the holdings listed in its lastest report against the roster of the S&P500 idnex; if they look alike, shop for another fund**
	- When analyzing a fund you should look at the fund's expenses, the riskiness of the fund, the manager's reputation, then at past performance. In that order. Only after accessing all of these you can look at the MorningStar rating
	- There are hundreds of closed-end bond funds, with especially strong choices available in the minicipal-bond area. When these funds trade at a discount, their yield is amplified and they can be attractive, so long as their annual expenses are below the thresholds listed above
	- So when shoudl you sell a fund (pg. 254):
		- A sharp and unexpected change in strategy
		- An increase in expenses
		- Large and frequent tax bills
		- Suddenly erratic return
- Chapter 10: The Investor and His Advisers
- Chapter 11: Security Analysis for the Lay Investor
	- The security analyst deals with the past, the present, and the future of any given security issue. He describes the business; he summarizes its operating results and financial position; he sets forth its strong and weak points, its possibilites and risks; he estimaties its future earning power under various assumptions, or as a "best geuss". He makes elaborate comparisions of various companies, or of the same company at various times. Finally, he expresses an opinion as to the safety of the issue, if it is a bond or investment grade preferred stock, or as to its attractiveness as a purchase, if it is a common stock.
	- The chief criterion uses for corporate bonds is the number of times that total interest charges have been covered by available earnings for some years in the past
	- **Common-Stock Analysis
		- The ideal form of common-stock analysis leads to a valuation of the issue which can be copmpared with the current price to determine whether or not the security is an attractive purchase
		- The reader will note that quite a number of the individual forecasts were wide of the mark. This is an instance in support of our general view that composite or group estimates are likely to be a good deal more dependable than those for individual companies. Ideally, perhaps, the security analysts should pick out the three or four companies whose future he thinks he knows the best, and concentrate his own and his clients' interest on what he forecasts for them.
		- Although two companies might have the same figure of expected earnings per share in 1973-1975, say $4, the analyst may value one as low as 40 and the other as high as 100. Let us deal briefly with some of the considerations that enter into these diveregent multipliers:
			1. General Long-Term Prospects
			2. Management
			3. Financial Strength and Capital Structure
			4. Dividend Record
			5. Current Dividend Rate
		- Our formula for the valuation of growth stocks:
			- Value = Current (Normal) Earnings * (8.5 plus twice the expected annual growth rate)
			- The growth figure should then be expected over the next seven to ten years
		- There is really no way of valuing a high-growth company (with an expected rate above, let's say, 8% annually)
		- Our own observation leads us to minimize somewhat the practical value of most of the industry studies that are made available to investors. The material developed is ordinarily of a kind with which the public is already fairly familiar and that has already exered considerable influence on market quotations
		- **A Two-Part Appraisal Process
			- We suggest that analysts work out first what we call the "past-performance value", which is based solely on the past record
			- The second part of the analysis should consider to what extent the value bases solely on past performance should be modified because of new conditions expected in the future
				- Such a procedure would divde the work between senior and junior analysts as follows: (1) The senior analyst would set up the formula to apply to all companies generally for determining past performance value. (2) The junior analysts would work up such factors for the designated companies-pretty much in mechanical fashion. (3) The senior analyst would then determine to what extent a company's perforamcen-absolute or relative-is likely to differ from its past record, and what change should be made in the value to reflect such anticipated changes. It would be best if the senior analyst's report showed both the original valuation and the modified one, with his reasons for the change.
- Chatper 11 Commentary
	- Graham says these are the five things to look for to make sure you're not overpaying for a stock:
		1. The company's "general long-term prospects"
		2. The quality of its management
		3. Its financial strength and capital structure
		4. Its dividend record
		5. Its current dividend rate
	- **The long term prospects**
		- Comb through financial statements, gathering evidence to help you answer two overriding questions. What this compnay grow? Where do (and where will) its profits come from?
		- **Among the problems to look out for:**
			- The company is a "serial acquirer". An average of mroe than two or three acquisitions a year is a sign of potential trouble
			- The company is an OPM addict, borrowing debt or selling stock to raise boatloads of Other People's Money. These fat infusions of OPM are labeled "cash from financing activites" on the statement of cash flows in the annual report
			- The company is a Johnny-One-Note, relying on one customer (or handful) for most of its revenues
		- **Among the good signs:
			1. The company has a wide "moat", or competitve advantage. Like castles, some companeis can easily be stormed by marauding competitors, while others are almost impregnable. 
				- **Several forces can widen a companies moat:**
					1. A strong brand identity (thing of Harley Davidson, whose buyers tatto the company's logo onto their bodies)
					2. A monopoly or near-monopoly on the market
					3. Economies of scale, or the ability to supply huge amounts of good or services cheaply (consider Gilette, which churns out razor blades by the billion)
					4. A unique intagible asset (think of Coca-Cola, whose secret formula for flavored syrup has no real physical value by maintains a priceless hold on consumers)
					5. A resistance to substituions (most businesses have no alternative to electricity, so utility companies are unlikely to be supplnated any time soon)
			2. The company is a marathoner, not a sprinter. By looking back at the incom statements, you can see whether revenues and net earnings have grown smoothly and steadily over the previous 10 years. If earnings are growing at a long-term rate of 10% pretax (or 6% to 7% after-tax), that may be sustainable. But the 15% growth hurdle that many companies set for themselves is delusional
			3. The company sows and reaps. No matter how good its products or how powerful its brands, a copany must spend some money to develop new business. While research and development spending is not a source of growth today, it may well be tomorrow-particularly if a firm has a proven record of rejuvenating its businesses with new ideas and equipment. In the long run, a company that spend nothing on R&D is at least as vulnerbale as one that spends too much
	- **The quality and conduct of management
		- A compnay's executives should say what they will do, then do what they said. Read the past annual reports to see what forecasts the mangers made and if they fulfilled them or fell short. Managers should admit their failures and take responsibility for them, rather than blame something else. Check whether the tone and substance of the chairman's letter stay constant, or flucuate with the latest fads on Wall Street. 
		- **Look for these things when analyzing management**
			1. Are they looing out for number 1?
				- A firm that pays its CEO $100 million in a year had better have a good reason. Otherwise, this kind of obscenely obese payday suggests that the firm is run by the managers, for the managers.
				- If a company reprices (or "reissues" or "exchanges") its stock options for insiders, stay away
				- By looking at the annual report for the mandatory footnote about stock options, you can see how large the "option overhang" is. AOL Time Warner, for example, reported in the front of its annual repor that it had 4.5 billion shares of common stock outstanding as of Decemeber 31, 2002-but a footnote in the bowels of the report reveals that the company had issues options of 657 million more shares. So AOL's future earnings will have to be divided among 15% more shares. You should factor in the potential flood of new shares from stock options whenever you estimate a copmany's future value
				- Look for insider buying/ very large selling during important times
			- Are they managers or promoters?
				1. Executives should spend most of their time manaing their company in private, not promoting it to the investing public
				2. Ask whether the company's accounting practices are designed to make its financial results transparent-or opaque. If "nonrecurring" charges keep recurring, "extraordinary" items crop up so often the seem ordinary, acronyms like EBITDA take priority over net income, or "pro forma" earnings are used to cloak actual losses, you may be looking at a firm that doesn't put shareholders first
	- **Financial strength and capital structure
		- The most basic definition of a good business is this:
			- It generates more cash than it consumes> Good managers keep finding ways of putting that cash to productive use
		- Start by seeing whether cash from operations has grown steadily throughout the past 10 years. Then you can go further and look at "[[owner earnings]]". If owner earnings per share have grown at a steady average of at least 6% to 7% over the past 10 years, the company is a stable generator of cash, and its prospects for growth are good
		- Turn to the balance sheet to see how much debt (including preferred stock) the company has; in general, long-term debt should be under 50% of total capital. In the footnotes tot the financial statements, determine whether the long-term debt is fixed-rate (with constant interest payments) or variable (with payments that fluctuate, which could become costly if interest rates rise)
		- Look at the annual report for the exhibit or statement showing the "ratio of earnings to fixed charges". That exhibit to amazom.coms 2002 annual report shows that amazon's earnings fell $145 million short of coverings its interest fees. If it doesn't fix this the company could end up being owned not by its shareholders but by its bondholders
	-  **A few words on dividend and stock policy**
		- Look at page 309 for a quick brief on divdends
		- Dividends will also be talked about more in-depth in chapter 19 
- Chapter 12: Things to Consider About Per-Share Earnings
	- Two pieces of advice are: (1) Don't take a signle year's earnings seriously, and (2) If you do pay attention to short-term earnings, look out for booby traps in the per-share figures
	- The more seriously investors take the per-share enarings figures as published, the more necessary it is for them to be on their guard against accounting factors of one kind and another that may impair the true comparability of the numbers. We have mentioned three sorts of these factors:
		1. The use of *special charges*, which may never be reflected in the per-share earnings
		2. The reduction in the normal *income-tax* deduction by reason of past losses
		3. The *dilution* factor implicit in the existence of substantial amounts of convertible securities or warrants
		4. "Pro forma" financial statements, which report a company's earnings as if Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) did not apply
		5. The dilutive effect of issuing millions of stock options for executive compensation, then buying back millions of shares to keep those options from reducing the value of the common stock
		6. Unrealistic assumptions of return on the company's pension funds, which can artificially inflate eanrings in good years and depress them in bad
		7. "Special Purpose Entities", or affiliated firms or partnerships that buy risky assets or liabilites of the company and thus "remove" those financial risks from the company's balance sheet.
		8. Treatment of marketing or other "soft" costs as assets of the company, rather than as normal expenses of doing business
	- *Average Earnings* are a "mean figure" which is useful for ironing out the fequent ups and down of the business cycle, and it was thought to give a better idea of the company's earning power than the results fo the latest year alone. One important advantage of such an averaging process is that it will sovle the problem of what to do about nearly all the special charges and credits. They should be included in the average earnings. When doing these averages use the past 7 or 10 years
	- It is of prime importance that the growth factor in a company's record be taken adequately into account. We suggest that the growth rate itself by calculated by comparing the average of the last three years with corresponding figures ten years earlier
	- High multiples have been maintained in the stock market only if the company has maintained better than average profitability
- Chapter 12 Commentary
	- Pro Forma (non-GAAP) earnings enable companies to show how well they might have done if they hadn't done as badly as they did. As an intelligent investor, the only thing you should do with pro forma earnings is ignore them
	- Capital Expenditures are an essential tool for managers to make a good business grow bigger and better. But some companies use this as a way to make expenses look like assets so the Intelligent investor should be sure to understand what, and why, a company capitalizes
	- The intelligent investor must always be on guard for "nonrecurring" costs that just keep on going/ recurring
	- Here are some quick considerations for the intelligent investor: Is the "net pension benefit" more than 5% of the company's net income? (If so, would you still be comfortable with the company's other earnings if those pension gains went away in future years?) Is the assumed "long-term rate of return on plan assets" reasonable? (As of 2003, anything above 6.5% is implausible, while a rising rate is downright delusional)
	- **A few pointers will help you avoid buying a stock that turns out to be an accounting time bomb:
		1. Read Backwards
			- When you research a company's financial reports, start reading on the last page and slowly work your war toward the front. Anything that the company doesn't want you to find is buried in the back-which is why you should look there first
		2. Read the notes
			- Never buy a stock without reading the footnotes to the financial statements in the annual report. Usually labeled "summary of significant accounting policies", one key note describes how the company recognizes revenue, records inventories, treats installment or contract sales, expenses its marketing costs, and accounts for the other major aspects of its business. In the other footnotes, watch for discolsures about debt, stock options, loans to customers, reserves against losses, and other "risk factors" that can take a big chomp out of earnings. Among the things that should make your antennae twitch are technical terms like "capitalized", "deferred", and "restructuring"-and plain English words signaling that the company has altered its accounting practices, like "began", "change", and "however". None of those words mean you should not buy a stock, but all mean that you need to investigate further. Be sure to compare the footnotes with those in the financial statements of at least one firm that's a close competitor, to see how aggressive your company's accountants are
		3. Read More
			- If you are an enterprising investor willing to put plently of time and energy into your portfolio, then you owe it to yourself to learn more about finacnial reporting. That's the only way to minimize your odds of being misled by a shifty earnings statement
- Chapter 13: A Comparision of Four Listed Companies
	- A high rate of return on invested capital often goes along with a high annual growth rate in earnings per share
	- High valuations entail high risks
	- It often proves much more difficult to continue to grow at a high rate after volume and profits have already expanded to big totals
	- Seven statistical requirements for inclusion in a defensive investor's portfolio (summarized and expanded on in the next chapter):
		1. Adequate size
		2. A sufficiently strong financial condition
		3. Continued dividends for at least the past 20 years
		4. No earnings deficit in the past ten years
		5. Ten-year gorwth of at least one-third in per-share earnings
		6. Price of stock no more than 1.5 times net asset value
		7. Price no more than 15 times average earnings of the past three years
- Chapter 13 Commentary
	- Companies that don't offer a dividend and retaining all its earning with the reasoning "to provide funds for the continued growth of the company" often mean, in practice, "to provide funds for the continued growth of the company's top mangers' wealth"
	- "Today's Investor", Graham tells us, "is so concerened with anticipating the future that he is already paying handsomely for it in advance. Thus what he has projected with so much study and care may actually happen and stillnot bring him any profit. If it should fail to materialize to the degree expected he may in fact be faced with a serious temporary and perhaps even permanent loss"
- Chapter 14: Stock Selection for the Defensive Investor
	- The defensive investor who follows our suggestions will purchase only high-grade bonds plus a diversified list of leading common stocks. He is to make sure that the price at which he bought the latter is not unduly high as judge by applicable standards
	- In picking stocks he would apply a set of standards to each purhcase, to make sure that he obtains (1) a minimum of quality in the past performance and current financial position of teh company, and also (2) a minimum of quantity in terms of earnings and assets per dollar of price.
	- **Criteria for accessing quality and quantity of a stock**:
		1. Adequate Size of the Enterprise
			- Our idea is to exclude small companies which may be subject to more than average vicissitudes especially in the industrial field
			- Prices they gave were not less than $100 million of annual sales (adjusted for inflation $753 million) for an industrial company, and not less than $50 million (adjusted for inflation: $376 million) of total assets for a public utility
		2. A Sufficiently Strong Financial Condition
			- For industrial companies current assets should be at least twice current liabilities. Also, long-term debt should not exceed the net current assets(or "working capital"). For public utilities the debt should not exceed twice the stock equity (or book value)
		3. Earnings Stability
			- Some earnings for the common stock in each of the past ten years
		4. Dividend Record
			- Uninterrupted payments for at least the past 20 years
		5. Earnings Growth
			- A minimum increase of at least one-third in per-share earnings in the past ten years using three-year averages at the beginning and end
		6. Moderate Price/Earnings Ratio
			- Current price should not be more than 15 times average earnings of the past three years
		7. Moderate Ratio of Price to Assets
			- Current price should not be more than 1.5 times the book value last reported. However, a multiplier of earnings below 15 could justify a correspondingly higher multiplier of assets. As a rule of thumb we suggest that the product of the multiplier times the ratio of price to book value should not exceed 22.5 (This figure corresponds to 15 times earnings and 1.5 times book value. It would admit an issue selling at only 9 times earnings and 2.5 times asset value)
	- Our basic recommendation is that the stock portfolio, when acquired, should have an overall earnings/price ratio-the reverse of the P/E ratio-at least as high as the current high-grade bond rate. This would mean a P/E ratio no hgiher than 13.3 against an AA bond yield of 7.5%
	- For the defensive investor the central appeal of the public-utility stocks at this time should be their availability at a moderate price in relation to book value
	- If a stock moves excessively up and you think it would be good to sell and buy cheaper stocks it is worth paying the capital gains tax rather than to hold the stock
	- **Investing in finacial enterprises
		- It is characteristic of all these enterprises that they have a relatively small part of their assets in the form of material things-such as fixed assets and merchandise inventories-but on the other hand most categories have short-term obligations well in excess of their stock capital. The question of financial soundness is, therefore, more relevant here than in the case of the typical manufacturing or commercial enterprise
		- Our counsel for analyzing *financial enterpirses* is the same arithmetical standards for price in relation to earnings and book value be applied to the choice of companies in these groups as we have suggested for industrial and public-utility invesments
	- **Railroad Issues
		- There is no compelling reason for the investor to own railroad shares
		- In the footnotes it says "The advice in this section is at least as relevant to airline stocks today-with their massive current losses and a half-century of almost incessantly poor results-as it was to railroads in Graham's day"
	- **Selectivity for the Defensive Investor
		- If the analysts were agreed that one particular stock was better than all the rest, that issue would quickly advance to a price which would offset all of its previous advantages
		- Graham is summarizing the "efficient markets hypothesis", or EMH, an academic theory claiming that the price of each stock incorporates all publicly available information about the company. With millions of investors scouring the market every day, it is unlikely that severe mispricings can persist for long. An old joke has two finance professors walking along the sidewalk; when one spots a $20 bill and bends over to pick it up, the other grabs his arm and days, "don't bother. If it was really a $20 bill, someone would have taken it already." While the market is not perfectly effecient, it is pretty close most of the time-so the intelligent investor will stoop to pick up the stock market's $20 bills only after researching them thoroughly and minimizing the costs of trading and taxes
		- Every competent analyst looks forward to the future rather than backward to the past, and he realizes that his work will prove good or bad depending on what *will* happen and not on what *has* happened. Nevertheless, the future itself can be approached in two different ways, which may be called the way of *prediction* (or projection) and the way of *protection*
		- Those who emphasis prediction will endeavor to anticipate farily accurately just what the company will accomplish in the future
		- Those who emphasize protection are always especially concerned with the price of the issue at the time of study. Their main effort is to assure themselves of a substantial margin of indicated present value above the market price-which margin could absorb unfavorable developments in the future
		- "We are not willing to accept the prospects and promises of the future(of a company) as compensation for the lack of sufficient value in hand"
		- Investing on the basis of projection is a fools errand; even the forecasts of the so-called experts are less reliable than the flip of a coin. For most people, investing on the basis of protection-from overpaying for a stock and from overconfidence in the quality of their own judgement-is the best solution

	- If you build a diversified basket of stocks whose current assets are at least double their current liabilities, and whose long-term debt does not exceed working capital, you should end up with a group of conservatively financed companies with plenty of staying power
	- **Earnings Growth
		- Graham set a very low hurlde; 33% cumulative growth over a decade is less than a 3% average annual increase. Possibly use 50% or even 100%
	- **Moderate P/E Ratio
		- It's nonsensical to derive a price/earnings ratio by dividing the known current price by unknown futrue earnings. Over the long run, money manager David Dreman has shown, 59% of Wall Street's "consensus" earnings forecasts miss the mark by a mortifyingly wide margin
		- Instead, calculate a stock's price/earnings ratio youself, using Graham's formula of current price divided by average earnings over the past three years
	- **Due Diligence
		- If institutions own over 60% of a company that could suggest that a stock is scarcely undiscovered and probably "overcrowded"
