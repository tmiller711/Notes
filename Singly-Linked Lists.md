- A linked list node is a special kind of struct with two members:
	1 - Data of some type (int, char, float)
	2 - A [[pointer]] to another node of the same type

- A linked list can string together data to make up for the downfalls of an [[array]]. With singly-linked lists you can add more data easily.
