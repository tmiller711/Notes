- The bottom line is this : **A change in order flow comes BEFORe a change in price**
- Lesson 1 - The Basics
	- The orders in the DOM (Depth of Market) are limit orders
	- The market order is accepting a slightly worse price to get into the market as fast as possible
	- There are two prices in the market, the inside bid (the highest bid price) and the inside ask (the lowest ask/offer price). If all of the bids are consumed by seller market orders, price will move down. If all of the offers are consumed by buyer market order, price will go up. **This is the basis on which we analyze order flow
	- In Summary:
		- At any time we have two prices and these prices are limit orders to buy and sell. No trades are made unless somebody 'hits' one of these prices with a market order. This process of hitting the limit orders will reduce the number of limit orders at a level. the people with the limit orders often pull them out of the way. This could be because they never intended to trade in the first place or that they want to move aside because they think better prices can be had later. The process of these limit orders being hit and pulled is what causes the markets to move up and down. Whilst every buyer has a seller, there can be buying pressure and selling pressure when the limit orders on one sdie are being traded away with people placing market orders
- Lesson 2: The Benefits - Lowering Your Risk
	- The inside bid can be thought of as "The price someone that wants to SELL NOW will get"
	- The inside offer can be thought of as "The price someone that wants to BUY NOW will get
- Lesson 3: The Learning Curve
	- By "Tape Reader" they mean someone that reads the flow of executed trades (Time & Sales) as well as the limit orders on the DOM
	-  Here are some suggestions on what individual components of the market to focus on:
		1. Buying and Selling Activity - When you start, you should not try to focus on the activity of both buyers and sellers. One side is enough. If you are looking at a reversal from a move down, then the activity of the sellers OR buyers could be your main focus. Later, you will be able to watch both sides. Initially your focus should be on absorbing one side
		2. Rhythm - Get into the rhythm of the tape. Summary Tape/Depth&Sales are best for this. Simply watch it and see how it ticks up and down over time. To do this, you need to focus on both the colors of the lines as well as the prices. Focus on just the bid price initially but later expand this so that on ticks down, you are focused on the new bid, but on ticks up you are focues on the new ask. As much as possible, track where price has been mentally. Don't worry about the other numbers, just the rhythm
		3. Delta - Delta is something I glace at periodically. It tends to make consistent moves up and down but will ocassionally make leaps as momentum changes. When you watch delta keep a mental track on what is normal in terms of moves up and down. Over days, keep track of how high delta tends to go. You might see that on a range day on the ES, +/- 20k delta is normal before a reversal. On the 6E, this number may only be +/- 3k
		4. Size to move through levels
		5. Small traders versus large traders - I use 2 Reconstructed Tapes to observe this. One for small players, on for large. On the ES. I use a filter of 100 contracts for determining large/small trades and on the 6E I use 10 contracts. On the large side, make sure that as well as the overall picture (red prints vs green prints) you are looking for the different size of traders. On the ES - we may see a lot of 100 prints but fewer 500 lot and very few 1200 lot trades. Make sure you can see these prints. Make sure you take note of the time. If there hasn; been a large print for 3 minutes AND this is an exception for this market. It is significant
		6. Absense of Trades - What you don't see can be as important as what you do see. If something occurs regularly and then stops, it is important. If you are looking to go long and the sellers disappear, do you really need to wait for buyers to jump in before you trade? Keep this in mind. Similarly, if we come up to a level and no contracts print, we move away and come back to the level and no contracts print again, it is a good sign that no-one is willing to buy there
		7. Size of Depth - Look out for large limit orders, especially as we come to key levels. Watch how buyers react when coming up to a large offer, do they she away from it? Do they aggressively buy into it? Does the offer shrink? Does the offer grow?
	- The four components of the auction are: Market Sellers, Market Buyers, Bidders, Offers
	- If the market is one sides with only buyers on the way up, then be very wary.
- Lesson 4: Tape Reader Setup
	- The summary tape is used to guage the flow of trades and who is in control, the Reconstructed Tape is used to see what side the big players are trading
	- His main focus when tape reading is on the summary tape but he will glance at the reconstructed tape from time to time to see which side the big players are on
- Lesson 5: Summary Tape
	- The summary tool is not intended to be a 'snapshot tool'. By that I mean you should not expect to be able to glance at the Summary Tape and immediately tell if the market will go up or down. The summary tape is about seeing changes over time
	- In terms of the types of behaviors you can look for:
		1. Market can 'thicken up'
			- The amount of trades to go down through each level steadily increases. An aggressive trader could go long at this point, a less aggressive trader could wait for the sellers to realize what is happening and for them to stop selling
		2. We can run out of sellers
			- This often happens in an exhaustive/capitulative move. We see a large volume of 'excited' sellers jump into the market, often combined with bidders thinning out. At some point, we simply run out of sellers, everyone that wants to sell has sold. The liquidity providers now have long posiitions and it doens't take much to get people to jump on a move back up, including of course, those poor sellers who joined at the end
		3. The market can just make a lazy turn without much fanfare or sign at all. A gradual move from selling to buying
		4. Buyers jump in from nowhere in huge size
	- For him the scenario he looks out for in the 'thicken up' as he says it's the easiest to trade on the ES
	- Watch for the market to thicken up when coming into an area of support or resistance. This can confirm the area

- Lesson 6: The Reconstructed Tape
	- In thicker markets with a higher volume volume of trades and less price movement. the Summary Tape is easier to read
	- The advantage of Reconstructed Tape is in being able to track large traders
	- As well as considering what we see on the Reconstructed Tape, it is worthwhile considering what we don't see. for instance, if I want to take a long trade on the ES with a 6 tick target, I will consider the absence of large sellers to be favorable. I consider this to be a more aggressive use of the Reconstructed Tape whereas waiting for large traders to jump in is a less aggressive way to use it
- Lesson 7: Depth & Sales
	- Limit orders show an intent to trade at a price. You can see these ahead of time, long before they are traded.
