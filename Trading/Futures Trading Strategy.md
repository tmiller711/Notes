 Add more detail about how to use these strategies to these things
- Wick test
- Cumulative delta
- VWAP bands
	- The bands act as support and resistance
	- If we are far above the VWAP (yellow band) we don't want to be going long. Same for being far below VWAP
	- There is a better chance for a bounce of a band if it hasn't been tested in awhile
	- He says if you are breaking through levels and you think it will reverse and you are trading micros you can just add another contract at each level
	- He says the major way he uses the bands is if you were hugging below/above VWAP and then it breaks through (VWAP) and tests a different band on the other side that hasn't been tested in awhile there is a good bounce opportunity
- Multiple timeframes
- 15 minute reversal
	- This is when during the overnight session there was an upward trend. What will happen is the buyers during the overnight session will take profit and the market will drop forming the low for the day. This usually happens within the first 15 minutes of the day (the 3rd candle)
- Magical 20s and 80s
	- He says the 20s and 80s are natural support and resistance levels
